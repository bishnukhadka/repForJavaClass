Day7 - 7/5/22

runnable - interface
if there is only one method in the interface it can be converted into a lamda expression


lamda expression 
()->method()
if the code is only few code use lamda expression
only works when interface has only one method. 
fuctional interface - interface with only one method.
to denote it we use @FunctionalInterface
unadviced for methods with more than line of code. 
- if more than one method you cannot use lamda

note: if put only 2, java undrstands it as int.
            2.0 as double(you can write 2d instead)
            for float, you have to write 2f


toString() = a method that gives the name of the object 
- is in 'Object' class.
- even when not written, any class automatically extends 'Object' class.

when running a program in cmd promt, when we do ".\", it searches the current directory for the program or script.
